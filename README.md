# AI-Powered Text Summarizer App

## What I Built

I worked on an AI-powered text summarizer app that takes a very large text input and condenses it to return
a concise, efficient text that encapsulates the main points of the respective content.

## Exact Functionality

Rundown of what the application accomplishes in a step-by-step summary:
1. The user is prompted to insert text that they wish to summarize.
2. The user can submit their text with a “summarize” button and receive an AI-powered summary in an output textarea.
